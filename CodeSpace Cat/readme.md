# Project Overview
I coded a website for CodeSpace Cat who shares their interests, skills and portfolio containing some of their previous work. It is targeted towards parties looking for a software developer and CodeSpace Cat is appealing themself as a fit candidate. With their credentials already outlined, at the bottom of the page is a contact section where potential clients can reach out for CodeSpace Cat's services. To start off the site, there is a list of sub headings that contain huperliks to the content within the page for easy access for users. An image of CodeSpace Cat follows the list so that the viewer is familliar with website owner and then thumbnails to their other projects are organised in a table for logical viewing. And lastly forms are utilised so that the viewer is able to contact Codespace Cat directly through the website.
